# exploratory_project
Exploratory project under Prof. L.P. Singh sir Mathematical Sciences, IIT(BHU) Varanasi, from July 2024 to November 2024.


In this project, I've explored a little into deep learning, convolusion neural networks, and pre-trained models like YOLO.

The repository contains notebooks and a video.py file which when run captures live video from web camera and shows the video with bounding boxes around humans detected in the frame, using the weights and biases obtained after training the YOLO model.

The project concludes with comparision between pre-trained and untrained YOLO models of same version after training the both of them on a custom dataset.
